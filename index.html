<p><strong>REAWAKENING ETHEREUM’S CYPHERPUNK SOUL</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: Dybsy</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum stands at a crossroads.</p>
<p>Born from the vision of a decentralized “world computer,” it was
meant to empower individuals with uncensorable applications and
financial self-sovereignty. Yet, as it grows, it faces mounting pressure
to conform – whether from commercialization that prioritizes convenience
over decentralization, or from regulators demanding compliance at odds
with privacy and censorship resistance.</p>
<p>This paper argues that Ethereum must realign with its
<strong>cypherpunk first principles</strong> to remain true to its
founding ideals and ensure its long-term resilience. In the face or
corporate influence and government oversight, Ethereum’s community
should recommit to the values of decentralization, privacy, and credible
neutrality that sparked the blockchain revolution.</p>
<p>By examining insights from Ethereum’s own leaders and the original
cyperphunk pioneers, critiquing key governance decisions, and charting a
path forward, I present a compelling case for making Ethereum cypherpunk
again – not for nostalgia’s sake, but to secure the network’s future as
an open platform beyond any state or corporate control.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum’s Cypherpunk Foundations</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum did not emerge in a vacuum – it was “born into a
counter-cultural movement, a cypherpunk movement.”<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
cypherpunks of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century were a group of
cryptographers and activists determined to use technology to protect
individual liberty in an age of expanding digital surveillance.</p>
<p>They believed in privacy, decentralization, and cryptographic
guarantees of freedom, coalescing around ideas like the <em>Cypherpunk’s
Manifesto</em>, which declared: “We must defend our own privacy if we
expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow
anonymous transactions to take place ... Cypherpunks write code...”<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This ethos inspired the first cryptocurrencies and ultimately
Ethereum itself.</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum founding team were deeply influenced
by Bitcoin and the cypherpunk ideals behind it. Ethereum’s original
mission was explicitly phrased in cypherpunk terms: to “build
unstoppable applications, empower decentralized communities, and ensure
financial sovereignty.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, Ethereum aimed to extend Bitcoin’s liberating
properties (censorship-resistant money) into a platform for <em>all</em>
forms of decentralized applications. The vision
was a world where no central authority could arbitrarily shut down your
software or seize your digital assets – <em>“unstoppable
applications”</em> running on a global, permissionless network.<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The mantra “code is law” captured
the intent that smart contracts on Ethereum would enforce rules
impartially, beyond the reach of any court or regulator.</p>
<p>Cypherpunk philosophy is baked into Ethereum’s DNA. Gavin Wood coined
the term Web3 to describe Ethereum as part of a decentralized internet
stack.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In this vision, Ethereum provides a
trustless computation layer – a “shared hard drive” – complemented by
peer-to-peer messaging and distributed storage to replace the
centralized servers of Web2.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Wood illustrated Web3’s
architecture of Ethereum + P2P networks as an open alternative to
today’s corporate cloud platforms. The goal was to “extend the spirit of
open source software to the world of today” by building systems that no
single entity can control or censor.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>From the start, Ethereum’s creators spoke the language of
cypherpunks. Decentralization was not just a means but an end in itself
– Ethereum was designed to “continue working even if its core developers
disappear forever.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Censorship-resistance was paramount
– no centralized actor should have the power to interfere with any user
or dAPP, and “[c]oncerns around bad actors should be addressed at higher
layers,” not by compromising the base layer’s neutrality.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
The network was to be globally auditable and trust-minimized, such that
anyone could run a node to verify what’s happening.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
In short, Ethereum strove to fulfill Nick Szabo’s dictum that “[t]rusted
[t]hird [p]arties are [s]ecurity [h]oles” by eliminating unnecessary
intermediaries and letting cryptographic protocols, not middlemen,
guarantee integrity.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Crucially, Ethereum expanded the cypherpunk ambition beyond digital
cash. As Vlad Zamfir noted, “In Ethereum, we went much further than
Bitcoin and said we didn’t just want to do this for money, but for
everything.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The Ethereum community sought to
apply cryptographic freedom technology to social contracts,
organizations, and markets of all kinds. This aligns with Tim May’s
<em>Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</em>, which foresaw a revolution where
“[c]omputer technology provides the ability for individuals and groups to
interact [anonymously]… altering completely the nature of government
regulation.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Ethereum picked up that torch,
aiming to “fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of
government interference in economic transaction.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
The very term “smart contract” (coined by Szabo) encapsulates the idea
of encoding agreements in unstoppable code, beyond the reach of legal
coercion.</p>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say Ethereum represented “a specter haunting
the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.”<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
By 2015, this specter had materialized into a live blockchain network
where anyone could deploy applications that no bank or government could
shut down. The launch of Ethereum realized what Hal Finney had
envisioned in 1992: “The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and
protect people, rather than to control them.”<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
Finney’s prophetic words – written when he discovered David Chaum’s
ideas on digital cash – resonate with Ethereum’s ethos of empowering
users. Chaum himself, decades earlier, had championed “[s]ecurity without
[i]dentification” and transaction systems to “make Big Brother
[o]bsolete.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Ethereum’s permissionless design
was a direct attempt to provide freedom from centralized surveillance
and control, turning those cypherpunk theories into practice.</p>
<p>In summary, Ethereum’s foundational values – decentralization,
censorship-resistance, privacy, open access, and self-sovereignty – are
drawn straight from the cypherpunk playbook. That is why early Ethereum
community members saw themselves as part of the same movement. They were
not merely building a fintech platform; they were building a political
and social alternative. But as we shall see, living up to those
principles has become an increasing challenge as Ethereum matured and
confronted the realities of mass adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Drifting from the Path: Commercialization and
Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Over the past several years, Ethereum’s explosive growth has tested
its commitment to its first principles. On the one hand, mainstream
success has validated Ethereum’s utility; on the other, it has brought
pressures that risk diluting its cypherpunk ethos. The 2017 ICO boom,
the 2020-21 DeFi and NFT crazes, and the 2022 Merge to Proof-of-Stake
each ushered in new stakeholders – traders, corporations, even
governments – whose priorities can diverge from decentralization and
privacy.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s culture and technology have shown signs of bending under
these influences. As Vitalik observed, “since 2017 or so, [the original]
visions have faded somewhat into the background… there is a large
ideological rift” between the crypto community and the broader tech
world.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> He laments that “few talk about
consumer crypto payments” or non-financial dApps now, and that high fees
turned the blockchain into a playground mostly for “degen gamblers”
during bull markets. In Vitalik’s view, this “adjusts the... crypto space’s
internal culture, [leading] to many... of the negatives [we have seen]” – a
polite way to say that money and hype have partially eclipsed the early
idealism.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>One clear sign of drift is the increasing compliance of major
Ethereum players with regulatory demands that run counter to cypherpunk
values. The most glaring example came in August 2022, when the U.S.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the
Tornado Cash mixer contract. Tornado was a privacy tool allowing users
to break the link between their addresses and funds – essentially
Chaumian digital cash implemented via smart contract. The OFAC action
effectively outlawed interaction with Tornado by U.S. persons.
Shockingly, several infrastructure providers immediately fell in line.
Infura and Alchemy began blocking requests to Tornado’s smart contract,
and Circle froze USDC balances, and even some frontends like AAVE
blacklisted those addresses.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> This unilateral
corporate compliance undermined the notion of Ethereum as an
unstoppable, neutral platform. The fact that a DeFi user could be
denied access to services due to external blacklists is exactly what
cypherpunks warned about.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>More troubling was the response at the protocol level after the
Merge. By October 2022, it was observed that over 50% of Ethereum blocks
were being produced by relays that enforced OFAC sanctions, excluding
Tornado-related transactions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> This was largely due
to the popularity of MEV-Boost relays (like Flashbots) used by stakers
to outsource block construction. In effect, a majority of block
proposers were voluntarily censoring certain transactions. Martin
Koppelmann noted the sad milestone when “52% of all blocks” were
subject to the content curation of a single relay.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
He remarked that the rapid roll-out of MEV-Boost “in hindsight was a
mistake” without more safeguards against censorship, as it let one
entity’s policy affect a majority of blocks.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>This scenario – a supposedly decentralized blockchain where half the
block producers follow government sanctions – starkly contradicts the
cypherpunk ideal of routing around censorship. John Gilmore’s famous
maxim that “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around
it” underscores that even centralized actors, like an exchange that
might be compelled to enforce such measures, should not dictate protocol
behaviour. Decentralized networks must be resilient.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
Ethereum’s reality in late 2022 was more disconcerting: the network
<em>tolerated</em> a significant amount of censorship at its core.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s leaders themselves expressed ambivalence on how to handle
this. Vitalik argued that if an individual home validator chooses to
censor, that “should be tolerated” to avoid becoming a “morality
police.”<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> He maintained that slashing should
be reserved only for concerted attacks like trying to reorg the chain
and “not [for] making wrong choices about what to put in your own
[block].”<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> In Vitalik’s view, as long as
<em>some</em> validators include the censored transactions (resulting in
delays but eventual inclusion – what Justin Drake calls “weak
censorship”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>), the situation, while undesirable,
is tolerable. Weak censorship degrades user experience but doesn’t
completely bar transactions from the chain.</p>
<p>The nightmare scenario is “strong censorship” – a majority actively
refusing certain transactions so that they <em>never</em> get
included.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> That would mean a user’s funds
could be effectively frozen on Ethereum, violating property rights as
surely as a bank freeze. Fortunately, Ethereum did not reach that
threshold; non-censoring validators continued to include Tornado
transactions, preventing a complete lock-out. But the fact remains: the
Ethereum protocol did <em>not</em> natively route around censorship – it
relied on social coordination and goodwill to counteract it.</p>
<p>This tenuis state alarmed many in the community who remembered that
Ethereum was supposed to be “neutral, and in such a way that anyone can
see that is neutral.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Another area of concern is the centralization trend in staking and
infrastructure. After the switch to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, Ethereum’s
security now depends on validators who stake ETH. But over 45% of staked
ETH is concentrated in a handful of providers (Lido, Coinbase, Kraken,
Binance).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Lido alone accounts for roughly 27.5% of the stake – a level that
Danny Ryan argued that no single staking entity should exceed, because
it undermines security and decentralization.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
If one provider controls greater than 33%, they could theoretically halt
finality; greater than 50% could soft-fork or censor; greater than 66%
could outright seize control of the chain.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, market forces have still favoured the largest
pools (“liquidity begets liquidity”<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>), and efforts to
self-limit have been voted down, such as when Lido actively opposed
Ethereum’s “no monocultures” ethos and over 99% of its voters rejected
capping its market share.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> This approach suggests
Lido’s intent to establish a staking monopoly–indeed, its vote signaled
that community concerns were less important than “growth at any cost.”<a
href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The outcome is that Ethereum’s validator set, while more
geographically distributed than mining was, is still far from the ideal
of decentralization. This concentration makes the platform more
vulnerable to pressure; e.g., a regulator can subpoena a large
U.S.-based exchange validator or a few big node operators, rather than
having to coerce thousands of independent home stakers. It also flies in
the face of the cypherpunk vision of <em>many small participants instead
of a few large intermediaries.</em> Szabo believed trusted third parties frequently made
mistakes or abused power, pointing out why reliance on
big custodians is dangerous.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
Ethereum’s reliance on Lido and centralized exchanges in staking
arguably reintroduces trust parties through the backdoor.</p>
<p>In contrast, Rocket Pool has remained more decentralized by design,
even decreasing its minimum minipool stake to 8 ETH, allowing more users to participate in securing the network.
Further, Rocket Pool voluntarily took the opposite path to Lido, pledging to
self-limit its own market share (around 22% maximum) and broadens its
node operator base as a safeguard against any single provider dominating
Ethereum).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Another promising mechanism is
FOCIL (EIP-7805), which enforces “inclusion lists” at the protocol level
so that even transactions targeted for censorship are forced into
blocks.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> FOCIL requires only a single honest
validator in a committee to include a censored transaction, thwarting
even majority censorship attempts.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>We must also consider Layer2 scaling solutions and their impact on
first principles. Ethereum’s roadmap since 2020 became <em>roll-up
centric</em>, meaning most users and transactions are expected to
migrate to Layer-2 networks that post data to Ethereum but execute
off-chain.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum,
Base, zkSync, and Starknet indeed offer greatly increased throughput and
lower fees – addressing a real need. But today, most rollups are not
sufficiently decentralized. They often have a single sequencer node
operated by the rollup’s team, which orders transactions.</p>
<p>These sequencers could censor or reorder transactions at will; users
have to trust it (at least until there are fraud proofs or
permissionless sequences). Moreover, many rollups started as
multisig-controlled “Layer2s” – essentially sidechains secured by a
handful of keys. Vitalik cautioned about this directly: “One can build a
system that one calls a ‘layer 2’, but which is actually a highly
centralized system secured by a multisig, with no plans to ever switch
to something more secure.”<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> If such systems
persist, Ethereum could devolve into a base layer that is decentralized
in name only, while activity migrates to corporate-controlled networks
riding on top. That outcome would be akin to using Ethereum as a
settlement layer of a new set of “too big to fail” intermediaries –
hardly the cypherpunk dream.</p>
<p>Vitalik has argued strongly against complacency here: “Resisting
these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the
unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and [we risk] recreating a clone
of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra
steps.”<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Vitalik reiterated the core values
that must guide Ethereum development: decentralization, censorship
resistance, auditability, credible neutrality, “building tools, not
empires”, cooperation.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> He gave concrete examples of what
<em>not</em> to do – like a “staking interface that needlessly funnels
users toward the already-largest staking pool”, or an NFT platform that
stores data on centralized servers. Each example reflects real
tendencies we’ve seen. His warning is clear: Ethereum could slip into
being just another walled garden or fintech warren if economic
convenience consistently trumps decentralization. In short, Ethereum
faces a creeping “Web2-ification”: the growth of <em>quasi-monopolies
and chokepoints</em> in an ecosystem that set out to eliminate them.</p>
<p>To be fair, Ethereum is still far more decentralized and open than
traditional financial or internet platforms. It continues to be a leader
in public blockchain development, and many community members are acutely
aware of these issues. But the trends point to a subtle but significant
shift away from the uncompromising cypherpunk stance of Ethereum’s early
years. This drift is not irreversible, but it is alarming to those who
believe Ethereum’s core value is as a bulwark against centralized
control. Decades ago, John Gilmore noted that every system faces a
tension between the “faceless organizations” that seek more control and
the individuals who seek more freedom.<a href="#fn46"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
Ethereum is now experiencing that tension firsthand. The next sections
will draw on thought leaders’ perspectives and specific governance
flashpoints to illustrate the urgency of realigning Ethereum with its
founding principles.</p>
<p><strong>Voices from Ethereum’s Community: Back to Basics</strong></p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ethereum retains a strong contingent of
voices advocating for the project’s original values. Many prominent
figures in the Ethereum community have spoken out about the importance
of decentralization, privacy, and credible neutrality – often echoing
cypherpunk themes directly. Let’s highlight some of these insights from
Ethereum’s thought leaders, and how they frame the need to
course-correct.</p>
<p><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> has emphasized a
return to first principles. He has stressed decentralization (“minimize dependence... on any
single actor”), censorship-resistance (no centralized actor should block
users), and credible neutrality of the base layer​. He defines credible
neutrality as infrastructure that “should be neutral, and in such a way
that anyone can see that it is neutral even if they don’t already trust
the developers.”​</p>
<p>In other words, the protocol must <em>demonstrably</em> treat all
users and transactions equally – a direct nod to avoiding biases or
blacklists. Vitalik has also championed privacy. He recently implemented
support for stealth addresses (one-time addresses for private receipts)
and has advocated “Privacy Pools” as a successor to Tornado Cash​.</p>
<p>In 2022, he tweeted: “I’ll oppose regulations that harm privacy or
decentralization. We don’t need KYC on DeFi frontends; that’d only
punish users while doing nothing to bad actors.” This aligns with his
view that Ethereum should not become an arm of financial surveillance.
Instead, he encourages building public goods like zk-Snark based voting
and identity tools that give individuals privacy by default​</p>
<p>Vitalik’s recent work on zero-knowledge proofs for identity (e.g. ZK
attestations via projects like Zupass) shows a commitment to
<em>practical cypherpunk solutions</em> – letting users prove things
about themselves without revealing personal data​. He paints a picture of
an “Ethereum-y cypherpunk world” where we hold assets in self-custody,
use anonymity systems for privacy, and participate in governance
pseudonymously​. Vitalik acknowledges the cultural drift and explicitly
wants to recenter the narrative around cypherpunk values:
<em>Decentralization, open participation, censorship resistance and
credible neutrality</em> should again become Ethereum’s north star​.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Lubin</strong><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> offers a perspective
from the intersection of Ethereum and regulators, and, interestingly, he
has become more outspoken in defense of Ethereum’s core principles as
governments have stepped up scrutiny. In a 2024, Lubin described the
U.S. SEC’s approach as <em>“gaslighting"</em> the industry and asserted
that the agency <em>“wants to reclassify ETH [as a security]”</em>,
which he is fighting against​. Lubin frames the conflict starkly: “Our
technology is about disintermediation… giving people and communities
direct financial and political agency. [The powers that be] don’t want a
world where people have direct access… It’s [about]... trying to kill or
slow this new technology.”​</p>
<p>Coming from someone who works closely with enterprises and
governments, this is a strong reaffirmation of cypherpunk ethos –
<em>empowering individuals versus entrenched institutions</em>. Lubin
also insists that Ethereum post-Merge is more decentralized and secure
than ever, pushing back against the SEC’s insinuation that PoS made
Ethereum more centrally controlled​</p>
<p>He emphasizes that validators “should be seen as [earning] income…
There is no investment contract” in simply participating in consensus​.
Lubin’s fight with the SEC (ConsenSys suing the SEC in 2023) is
essentially a fight to keep Ethereum free and open in the face of
regulation. Perhaps Lubin’s most impassioned comment was: “Something
unforgivable is that you [crypto companies] keep developing services
trying to be banks – the world doesn’t need more banks.”​</p>
<p>He was referring to exchanges acting as overly compliant custodians,
and urged the industry (his own company included) to <em>not</em>
recreate the legacy financial system, but to stick to crypto’s roots of
user empowerment. It’s heartening to see a figure like Lubin, often
associated with mainstream adoption, publicly championing privacy and
decentralization – speaking of Ethereum as part of a broader struggle
for the “future of the internet” against overreach​.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Wood</strong><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> insisted on
formalizing governance (he felt Ethereum’s governance was too ad-hoc
during The DAO crisis) and that on-chain decision-making was another
angle of aligning protocol behavior with stated values. He feared, essentially, the
governance-by-social- media approach could lead to inconsistencies in
upholding principles. Wood’s perspective spurred discussion on how to
make Ethereum’s governance transparent and incorruptible. Gavin also
stressed technological sovereignty, coining “Web 3.0” to mean a web
where decentralized protocols might replace tech giants. Today, that term is
widely used (and misused), but its origin signals a direct continuity
from cypherpunk ideals (anti-censorship, anti-monopoly) to Ethereum’s
mission.</p>
<p><strong>Balaji Srinivasan</strong><a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>
wrote in his 2017 piece <em>“Quantifying Decentralization,”</em> (with
L. Lee) that “[t]he primary advantage of Bitcoin and Ethereum over their
legacy alternatives is… decentralization.”​ He introduced the concept of
the Nakamoto coefficient as a measure of how many distinct entities it
takes to collude to control a system​</p>
<p>This idea has become influential in Ethereum discussions post-Merge.
For example, people note that Ethereum’s Nakamoto coefficient across
various subsystems (nodes, clients, validators, etc.) should be high to
be truly decentralized​.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Balaji’s broader message was that
we must <em>measure and improve</em> decentralization continuously, lest
hidden central points undermine security​</p>
<p>He famously stated that “any blockchain is only as decentralized as
its least decentralized subsystem,” highlighting that even if consensus
is decentralized, reliance on centralized exchanges or APIs can
compromise the whole. This holistic view has galvanized efforts to
decentralize every layer of Ethereum – from the node infrastructure to
oracles, bridges, and more. Srinivasan’s push for objective metrics
serves as a reminder that decentralization isn’t a feel-good slogan –
it’s a property that can be lost if not rigorously safeguarded​.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Ryan</strong><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> has been vocal about
preserving decentralization in the new Proof-of-Stake era. He sounded
the alarm on liquid staking centralization, and argued that it’s not in
users’ true interest to chase slightly higher liquidity. Although he is
a technologist, his stance is essentially a moral and practical appeal
to decentralization – recognizing that convenience (pooling into the
biggest platform) can create systemic fragility. Post-Merge, Danny also
highlighted the <em>benefits</em> PoS brought in terms of lowering
barriers to participation: no need for specialized mining hardware means
“it’s much easier for many participants to participate” as validators,
making consensus “a bit more egalitarian”​</p>
<p>This reflects the intent behind PoS: to further democratize Ethereum;
however, Danny knows this promise only holds if thousands of individuals
<em>do</em> participate, rather than delegating to a few large pools.
His continued involvement in research like Distributed Validator
Technology (DVT) – which spreads a validator’s duties across multiple
nodes – is aimed at enabling more robust, decentralized staking. In
short, Danny Ryan provides a voice of technical conscience, ensuring
Ethereum’s evolution doesn’t sacrifice the decentralization that secures
it.</p>
<p>Recently, speaking at ETHDenver<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> in 2025 following his
appointment to Etherealize, Danny talked about <em>just doing it</em> –
that is, walking the path toward the new vision of blockchain adoption,
such as Larry Fink’s call to tokenize <em>everything</em>. Danny argued
that the regulatory pendulum always swings, and the Ethereum community
has a short window in which to ensure the comeback is not too great.</p>
<p><strong>Vlad Zamfir</strong><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> offers a thoughtful
counterpoint on some cypherpunk dogmas, yet ultimately reinforces
Ethereum’s need to define its own rules rather than bow to external
ones. Vlad infamously stated “code is not law”, arguing that the
doctrine of absolute immutability in blockchains is “not a legitimate
rule” in all cases​. He posited that immutability itself presents a model
of governance​ – essentially, choosing never to hard-fork is
itself a governance choice (one he felt was <em>hyper-paranoid</em> about state
power​). Zamfir was a proponent of acknowledging the social layer: that
sometimes the community must make decisions (as with The DAO fork) to
reflect its values. Some see this as anti-cypherpunk, since cypherpunks
tend to prefer strict rules over human intervention.</p>
<p>But Zamfir’s deeper message is that Ethereum should develop its own
native governance and legal system (a <em>crypto legal system</em>)<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>​,
rather than naively hoping to be above all law. He warned that
governments “will not let such a disruptive revolution take place”
without challenge, and that “Ethereum needs to adapt” its legal
approach​. He urged developers to plan for legal crises
rather than just grow and hope to be too big to regulate​. Importantly,
Vlad reminded the community that Ethereum was born from a cypherpunk,
counter-cultural movement, but to fulfill its aim it might need to
engage with law on its own terms​.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> His push resulted in
projects like OpenLaw and discussions around on-chain dispute
resolution.</p>
<p>While opinions differ on how to handle governance, Zamfir’s influence
ensured that Ethereum’s values were debated openly – e.g., to what
extent “code is law” should hold. The fact that Ethereum did not bail
out subsequent hacks (like the Parity multisig 2017) shows a nuanced
balance: the community’s social consensus is ultimately what enforces
the cypherpunk ethos. If the community strongly believes in no bailouts,
that norm will hold. Ethereum’s social layer thus becomes the guarantor
of principles – a very cypherpunk notion in itself (distrusting even
code at times, trusting voluntary human consensus).</p>
<p><strong>Others in the community</strong> have lent their voices:
<em>Hudson Jameson</em>, who facilitated Ethereum core dev calls for
years, often highlighted the importance of transparency and community
input in decisions<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> – keeping governance participatory
(he embodied the <em>“cooperative mindset”</em> Vitalik listed​).
<em>Justin Drake</em>, beyond his technical work on randomness and
cryptography, co-authored proposals like PBS (Proposer-Builder
Separation) explicitly to mitigate MEV centralization and censorship by
enshrining neutrality in the protocol​.<a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a><a
href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> Drake defined the distinction
between <em>“weak”</em> and <em>“strong”</em> censorship as noted,
educating the community on why any drift toward the latter must be
prevented​. <em>Preethi Kasireddy</em>, an educator and developer,
eloquently wrote about the <em>“synergies”</em> of Ethereum’s
decentralized ecosystem – how an open platform allows innovation to
compound in a positive-sum way​.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> She compared
Ethereum’s network effects to the early internet, arguing that
composability and permissionless innovation on Ethereum create a
<em>“whole new type of network effect”</em> that centralized platforms
cannot match​. Her perspective underscores that sticking to
decentralization isn’t just morally right, it economically
<em>amplifies</em> innovation (as dApps can plug into each other without
gatekeepers)​.</p>
<p>Finally, figures at the intersection of Ethereum and cypherpunk
activism, like Edward Snowden, although not Ethereum developers, have
indirectly bolstered Ethereum’s cause. Snowden has commented that
“Bitcoin’s biggest flaw is its lack of privacy” and called it an
“existential threat” to an otherwise great system​.<a href="#fn61"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
By extension, one can infer that Ethereum too must improve privacy or
face the same threat. His statement that “lack of privacy... is the only
protection users have from political change” encapsulates why Ethereum
must prioritize privacy tech​. Snowden also criticized crypto services
that “expose [users]” and act like banks, which directly applies to
things like Infura or centralized exchanges on Ethereum​. When such a
prominent privacy advocate and whistleblower engages with crypto
(Snowden even helped launch the privacy coin Zcash), it sends a message:
don’t lose sight of why these networks exist. They exist to empower
individuals in the face of surveillance and control.</p>
<p>The chorus from these diverse voices is clear: Ethereum’s value
proposition lies in its adherence to cypherpunk ideals. Decentralization
is not negotiable; credible neutrality must be preserved; privacy needs
to be protected and enhanced; and the community should proactively
resist trends toward recentralization. There is also a realization that
these principles must be <em>implemented</em> – through both technical
measures and cultural norms – and not merely paid lip service. Next, we
turn to concrete flashpoints in Ethereum’s history and present – from
the DAO fork to OFAC compliance – to see where it succeeded or fell
short, and what lessons they offer for the road ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Governance Crossroad: Lessons from Key Decisions</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum’s journey has been punctuated by critical governance
decisions that tested its commitment to first principles. Examining
these events can shed light on how Ethereum might better align with its
cypherpunk ethos going forward. We will focus on a few key episodes –
The DAO fork, OFAC censorship after the Merge, staking centralization
issues, and the rollup-centric roadmap – analyzing each through the lens
of Ethereum’s foundational values.</p>
<p><u>The Dao Fork: Code vs Law vs Values</u></p>
<p>In July 2016, just a year after launch, Ethereum faced an existential
crisis: The DAO hack. An attacker exploited a bug in a prominent smart
contract (the DAO) to drain 14% of all ETH. At that unique time, when
forking was technically feasible and the ETH supply affected was
proportionally massive, the community had to choose between adhering
strictly to <em>immutable code</em> or intervening via a hard fork to
undo the theft and restore the stolen ETH.</p>
<p>In a controversial decision, the majority (led by Vitalik and the
Foundation) chose to fork and restore the stolen ETH to a recovery
contract. This created Ethereum as we know it and a spin-off chain,
Ethereum Classic (ETC), where the hack was never reversed.</p>
<p>This incident is often cast as a showdown between cypherpunk
principles – immutability and rule by code – and human governance.
Detractors say Ethereum “broke” the principle that blockchains are
immutable, proving it will rewrite history under pressure, a slippery
slope. Indeed, The DAO fork was a deviation from pure “code is law.”
Nick Szabo was critical of the fork. Zamfir, by contrast, argued
that clinging to absolute immutability in all cases is misguided. He
posited that “immutability…is not a legitimate rule” if it leads to
outcomes that undermine the community’s broader goals​.<a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The community’s rationale for the fork was to protect users and
Ethereum’s reputation from a devastating exploit – essentially, to
enforce the <em>“spirit”</em> of the DAO contract (investors’ intent)
over the <em>“letter”</em> of its buggy code. This was an early
assertion of a kind of social layer sovereignty: the Ethereum community
asserted that it, not a thief, ultimately controlled the chain’s
destiny.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Ethereum’s cypherpunk alignment? On one hand,
Ethereum showed it would not be strictly anarcho-capitalist or
absolutist about code – it acknowledged a role for human values and
governance. On the other hand, the market punished Ethereum to an extent
via the split: Ethereum Classic continued as a reminder that a faction
felt the fork violated core principles (“Build unstoppable applications”
– yet The DAO was stoppable). Over time, ETC’s importance waned, and
Ethereum’s choice seemed vindicated as it enabled the platform to move
on and flourish.</p>
<p>The lesson here is complex: It may be that being true to cypherpunk
<em>ideals</em> (like empowering users and protecting them from thieves)
required violating one cypherpunk <em>axiom</em> (immutability). The DAO
fork sets a precedent that Ethereum’s community will act – in
extraordinary circumstances – to defend the broader vision of a fair,
open system.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the fork’s legacy is why Ethereum is <em>extremely
reluctant</em> to ever fork for contract disputes again. The norm
reasserted itself: “code is law” for dApps, and user beware. One can see
this as Ethereum learning a middle path: use governance sparingly, but
keep it as a backstop for <em>ethos</em>-level threats. As long as such
social consensus exists, it can serve as the ultimate guardian of the
network’s values (the “crypto legal system” Zamfir alluded to​).<a
href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, this dissonance was implicated very recently when ByBit was
hacked by North Korea’s “Lazarus” for $1.4 billion in ETH.<a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> Vitalik and others were immediately
petitioned for their perspectives on a hard fork to restore funds and
much community debate ensued. No hard fork occurred.</p>
<p>The DAO episode taught Ethereum the importance of clear values to
guide tough calls – in that case, the community valued the integrity of
the ecosystem over the absolutism of the ledger. Future crises (knock on
wood) will likely be met with similar consideration of core principles:
what course preserves Ethereum as a platform for <em>legitimate</em> use
(not rewarding criminals or censors)? Ideally, improvements like better
audited contracts, fail-safes, or insurance funds make such dilemmas
rare.</p>
<p><u>Censorship After the Merge: Holding the Line on Neutrality</u></p>
<p>As discussed, after Ethereum transitioned to PoS, it encountered the
censorship issue stemming from OFAC-sanctioned addresses. This was a
pivotal governance challenge, even if no explicit on-chain vote
occurred. The “governance” here was the collective behavior of
validators and the out-of-protocol coordination to address
censorship.</p>
<p>When more than half of new blocks became OFAC-compliant (i.e.,
excluding Tornado transactions)​<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>, the community grew
alarmed. Debates raged on Twitter and forums: Should Ethereum socially
slash validators who censor? Would users accept a fork of the chain that
slashed, say, major staking pools if they formed a cartel to enforce
OFAC rules?</p>
<p>Some, like former Bitcoiner Eric Wall, argued for a “social
slashing”<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> defense – essentially a
user-activated soft fork that burns the stake of censors​. Vitalik and
other developers signaled support for slashing in the extreme scenario
of persistent wholesale censorship (strong censorship)​.</p>
<p>But in practice, Ethereum has not had to cross that Rubicon. Instead,
efforts went into mitigating the problem: <em>economic incentives</em>
(MEV-Boost relays that don’t censor like Ultrasound Money relay started
gaining share), <em>Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) research</em> to
allow inclusion of censored transactions via separate channels, and
community pressure on entities like Flashbots to change. Köppelmann
noted in October 2022 that Flashbots and others “committed to take
actions if censorship [became] worse”, indicating that mere public
scrutiny was having an effect​.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> Indeed, by 2023 the
percentage of OFAC-censoring blocks dropped as new neutral relays came
online and validators adopted them.</p>
<p>This episode is still ongoing, but it highlighted a key point: the
Ethereum community by and large <em>rejects censorship</em> and is
willing to engineer around it. It’s a real-time example of Gilmore’s
principle – not automatically routing around damage, but consciously
developing the means to route around it. The credible threat of a
community fork or slashing likely discouraged any open collusion among
large validators to enforce sanctions at the protocol level. Coinbase’s
CEO Brian Armstrong even stated they would rather shut down staking
service than engage in on-chain censorship, showing alignment with
Ethereum’s ethos (and fear of backlash). This alignment of incentives
with principles is crucial.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that Ethereum had no built-in mechanism to prevent
greater than 50% censorship was a wake-up call. It underscored the need
to “enshrine” censorship-resistance into the protocol wherever possible.
One proposal by researchers (including Justin Drake) is to enshrine PBS
so that block proposers can always include <em>user-submitted “inclusion
lists”</em> of transactions they want to guarantee get in​.<a
href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> Another idea is decentralized
sequencers for rollups to avoid L2 censorship (we’ll get to rollups
next).</p>
<p>The governance lesson is that Ethereum must be proactive: it cannot
assume all validators will uphold neutrality out of goodwill. Social
consensus can act as a safety net (as it did, implicitly), but technical
measures to make censorship economically irrational or difficult are
better. Ethereum’s credible neutrality was stressed, but ultimately not
broken – a testament to the community’s shared values. This incident
reinforced that the community will rally to preserve openness when
confronted.</p>
<p>Going forward, formalizing this – perhaps with explicit <em>protocol
rules against censoring certain kinds of messages</em> or penalties for
censorship – could strengthen Ethereum’s cypherpunk cred; however, such
rules are tricky (how to distinguish censorship from network issues?).
More likely is continued reliance on off-chain governance to handle any
blatant censorship coalition, combined with software changes to minimize
its likelihood.</p>
<p><u>Staking and Infrastructure: Decentralize or Die</u></p>
<p>Another governance concern is the centralization of critical
infrastructure – namely staking providers and node infrastructure.
Unlike censorship, which saw an immediate flare-up, this is a
slow-burning issue of ecosystem governance: how to nudge the network
towards greater decentralization.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s protocol doesn’t currently cap how much ETH one entity can
stake or how many validators a single operator runs, primarily because
it is technically difficult to detect sock puppets and ensure fair
distribution. It instead relies on the open market. Governance here has
been more social and moral: prominent community members implore
decentralization. For example, discussions on Ethereum Magicians forum
and ETHResearch have floated ideas like <em>limiting protocol rewards
after a certain threshold of stake per entity</em>, or building
<em>in-protocol shuffling</em> of validators to mix assignments between
pools. No such hard measures have been implemented (they risk unintended
consequences). Instead, we’ve seen soft governance efforts: Lido, under
community pressure, proposed self-limiting (which failed that vote in
what can only be described as an act of defiance against Ethereum’s
vision and ethos), and is now working on concepts like Lido V2 with
Staking Router to onboard many more independent operators, diluting its
centralization​.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation and client teams continue to emphasize
running your own nodes and have made running a node lighter (e.g.
<em>stateless client research, offloading history to protocols like
Portal Network</em>). The Ultrasound Money community (Ethereum
proponents who highlight ETH’s deflationary aspect) interestingly also
emphasize decentralization, coining the meme “decentralization maximizes
ultrasoundness” – meaning if the network is decentralized, it is more
secure and thus the monetary properties hold. This kind of cultural
framing uses even economic narratives to push first principles.</p>
<p>One notable governance action was the client diversity effort. In
early 2021, it was noticed that over 70% of Ethereum nodes ran the Geth
client – a single codebase, a single point of failure. The community
(led by people like Péter Szilágyi and Danny Ryan) rang alarm bells.
Through <em>education, grants, and setting norms</em>, the Ethereum
network by Merge time had a healthier distribution among multiple
clients (Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, Nimbus on consensus; Geth, Nethermind,
Besu, Erigon on execution)​.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>This was an example of successful informal governance for a
cypherpunk goal: no monocultures. It showed that decentralization can be
achieved if the community agrees it’s critical and coordinates – in this
case, node operators and staking pools consciously switched or balanced
clients. Ethereum’s resilience post-Merge (no client bug brought down
the network) validated that push.</p>
<p>The broader lesson on infrastructure is that Ethereum must
continuously identify centralization risks and address them through
community coordination or protocol tweaks. Whether it’s reducing
reliance on Infura (through light clients in browsers or alternative RPC
networks like Pocket Network) or ensuring no single L2 becomes “too big
to fail,” these are governance challenges that require collective
action. They might not be resolved in all-hands votes, but through rough
consensus and building the alternatives.</p>
<p>In cypherpunk terms, this is the eternal vigilance required to “guard
against the risks of going too far in being community-driven”, as
Vitalik put it​ – interestingly warning that community whims should not
override neutrality. That cuts both ways: just as we don’t want
corporate dominance, we also don’t want a mob of users deciding to, say,
exclude a minority they dislike. Thus, governance must be balanced by
hard “norms of neutrality”​.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>For staking, this means even if users <em>want</em> the convenience
of one-stop staking, we as a community must educate and provide
alternatives to break the tendency toward central points.</p>
<p><u>Rollups and Layer 2: Scaling Without Sacrificing Ethos</u></p>
<p>Ethereum’s embrace of rollups as the preferred scaling solution is a
strategic decision with governance and ethos implications. By choosing
not to massively increase base layer throughput (to keep running a node
affordable), Ethereum stays aligned with decentralization at Layer 1.
Instead, the plan is to push activity to Layer 2 networks that inherit
security from Layer 1. This rollup-centric roadmap raises the question:
can these L2s maintain Ethereum’s cypherpunk values?</p>
<p>In the short term, many rollups are corporate or VC-backed projects
(e.g. Optimism PBC, Offchain Labs for Arbitrum, Matter Labs for zkSync).
They often began centralized for speed of iteration. This has led to
instances at odds with Ethereum’s ethos: e.g., Infura and Metamask
blocking users on some L2s during Tornado sanctions (since those UIs
were centralized). Also, a rollup operator could censor transactions or
preferentially include their friends’ trades – basically recreating a
mini version of a centralized system on top of Ethereum. The optimistic
view (shared by Vitalik and rollup teams) is that over time, rollups
will decentralize: they’ll have multiple sequencers, open validation
(especially zk-rollups where anyone can validate proofs), and perhaps
even community governance or alignment with ETH holders. But that
transition is a governance challenge.</p>
<p>Critics point out the risk of L2 fragmentation – if an L2 doesn’t
uphold values, users might not notice since they experience the L2
environment more than L1. For instance, an exchange could run a rollup
where only KYC’d addresses can withdraw to L1, effectively creating a
silo. Does Ethereum have a say in that? Possibly not directly – but
<em>indirectly yes</em>: Ethereum could refuse to upgrade in ways that
support such siloed rollups or socially oppose them. On the flip side,
Ethereum has supported technologies like EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)
to massively reduce rollup costs​, actively fostering rollups. This is a
bet that scalability can be achieved <em>without</em> compromising core
values at L1, if rollups eventually mirror those values.</p>
<p>Vitalik<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> has given guidance here too. He
noted that one can launch <em>a highly centralized system secured by a
multisig</em> and call it an L2, but that’s counter to Ethereum’s
values​. The community should <em>resist pressures</em> to use such
systems if they don’t plan to evolve toward trustlessness​. We see this
in practice: truly centralized “L2s” (really just sidechains) like
Polygon POS chain are not granted the same legitimacy in Ethereum
circles as rollups are, precisely because they don’t inherit Ethereum
security or decentralization (Polygon has its own 100 validators, which
could collude). Instead, the Ethereum community tends to favor solutions
that are <em>provably secured by Ethereum</em> (rollups publish data on
L1 and have proofs or challenge periods). This preference is an
<em>expression of cypherpunk values in scaling</em>: we prefer slower,
more complex solutions if they preserve trustlessness, over quick but
trust-based fixes. It shows a willingness to tolerate short-term
inconvenience (needing to bridge to rollups, etc.) to uphold the
long-term vision of an unstoppable, decentralized network of
networks.</p>
<p>Governance will soon come into play as rollups themselves
decentralize. For example, if Optimism transitions to multiple
sequencers or community governance of its protocol, will Ethereum
stakeholders get involved? Possibly – there could be cross-domain
governance issues, like how to manage shared bridges or fraud-proof
referees that might involve L1 contracts. Ethereum L1 developers have
also considered enshrining some rollup functionality (like a common
fraud proof verifier) into the L1 protocol, which has governance
implications (tying Ethereum’s fate to specific L2 implementations)​. So
far, Ethereum has avoided enshrining any single rollup, opting to keep
L1 general. This avoids picking winners – consistent with credible
neutrality.</p>
<p>In summary, the rollup strategy is Ethereum’s path to scale without
increasing centralization at L1, and it seems largely compatible with
cypherpunk principles if executed properly. The key will be ensuring
rollups themselves don’t become the new centralized choke points.
Governance of Ethereum may eventually extend to setting
<em>standards</em> for rollups (e.g. requiring them to provide proofs
for security, or encouraging social slashing if a rollup operator
maliciously censors despite users exiting on L1). These are novel
issues, but the community’s ethos can guide them: favor permissionless
innovation, insist on the ability to exit to L1 (so users always retain
self-custody ultimately), and promote interoperability so no L2 can
become a monopoly. Vitalik envisions a future where <em>“we can have
seamless integration between on-chain tokens and off-chain attestations"
secure against centralized censorship</em>​ – essentially a tapestry of
Layers that upholds freedom. Achieving that is a governance journey we
are just beginning.</p>
<p>Across these scenarios, a common thread emerges: when Ethereum has
deviated from cypherpunk ideals, either the community corrects course or
consequences ensue. The DAO fork, while contentious, was arguably in
service of fairness (a higher ideal). The OFAC compliance scare
triggered a backlash and corrective measures. Staking centralization, if
left unchecked, could erode Ethereum’s security and community trust –
hence many are actively working to counter it. Rollups introduce
temporary centralization, but the community is pushing them to
decentralize as they mature. Ethereum’s informal governance – the
debates, EIPs, social media discussions, and off-chain coordination –
has been the mechanism to negotiate these trade-offs. It’s messy but has
proved effective so far.</p>
<p>However, the pressures will only increase as Ethereum grows. What
happens when nation-states actively participate in staking or try to
influence protocol changes? Or when large corporations build
closed-source rollups that nonetheless settle on Ethereum? Ethereum will
need a strong, explicit grounding in its first principles to navigate
such challenges without fracturing. This leads us to consider concrete
steps Ethereum can take to reclaim and reinforce its cypherpunk ethos,
so that its trajectory over the next decade bends <em>away</em> from
centralization and capture, and <em>toward</em> greater freedom and
decentralization.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaiming Ethereum’s Cypherpunk Ethos: A
Roadmap</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum can re-align with its cypherpunk first principles through
deliberate technical, social, and economic steps. By fortifying the
properties of the network that empower individuals and resist
centralized control, Ethereum will not only stay true to its values but
also enhance its robustness. Here I propose a set of practical measures
– a <em>manifesto for action</em> – that the Ethereum community can
undertake to ensure the platform remains a beacon of open, decentralized
blockchain technology. These steps draw on the insights of thought
leaders and the lessons of past governance decisions discussed
above.</p>
<p><strong>1. Embed Privacy at the Heart of Ethereum:</strong> Privacy
is a core cypherpunk value and Ethereum must prioritize privacy
solutions at both Layer 1 and Layer 2. This means continuing to develop
and deploy technologies like zk-Snarks and stealth addresses to enable
anonymous transactions and account balances. Vitalik has prototyped
stealth addresses for ERC-721 assets and suggests their use for ETH and
ERC-20 transfers​.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Implementing EIPs that support one-time address protocols or
encrypted memo fields can lay the groundwork for more private
transactions. Moreover, supporting privacy-focused Layer 2s (like Aztec
Network’s zk-rollup with encrypted transactions) aligns with Ethereum’s
ethos – these solutions allow users to shield their activity from prying
eyes while still settling on Ethereum securely. As Eric Hughes wrote,
<em>“privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems”</em>, and Ethereum should become fertile ground for such
systems​.</p>
<p>The community should also oppose proposals that harm privacy, such as
blanket KYC requirements at the protocol or client level. Instead,
Ethereum can enable <em>selective disclosure</em>: users reveal
information <em>only</em> when they choose, via cryptographic proofs. By
championing tools like Passport (ZK identity proofs) and dark pools for
trading, Ethereum can fulfill the cypherpunk promise that <em>“an
anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.”</em>​</p>
<p>In practice, a more private Ethereum will involve integrating L1
support for things like BLS12-381 curves (for zk-SNARK efficiency) (such
as is included in Pectra) and making privacy-preserving dApps
first-class citizens. Ultimately, <em>financial privacy = financial
freedom</em>, and Ethereum’s credibility as the “World Computer” depends
on users being able to use it without broadcasting their entire life
on-chain.</p>
<p><strong>2. Harden Censorship Resistance at the Protocol
Level:</strong> Ethereum should not rely on social norms alone to handle
censorship – it must bolster the protocol with technical safeguards. One
approach is to implement Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) natively​.<a
href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> By separating block proposers
(validators) from transaction builders (who assemble optimal bundles),
Ethereum can prevent any single builder from having too much influence.
Even more, an <em>enshrined PBS</em> can require that multiple builders
or a committee collaborate, making censorship by one party
ineffective​.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, ideas like Inclusion Lists or Encrypted Mempools would
give validators a mechanism to flag certain transactions that must be
included in the next blocks or hide transaction contents until after
inclusion, respectively. The goal is to design Ethereum such that
<em>even if 50% of validators wanted to censor, they technically
couldn’t prevent inclusion of transactions</em> without breaking
consensus rules (and thus getting slashed). <em>Slashing conditions</em>
themselves might be extended in future to penalize overt censorship –
e.g., if a validator refuses to include a valid transactions for X slots
and others pick it up, that could count as a slashable offense.</p>
<p>This is tricky to get right, but the principle is to encode credible
neutrality into the chain’s logic. As Vitalik notes, base-layer
neutrality should be verifiable​.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Ethereum could, for
instance, randomize or constrain block contents in certain ways to foil
censoring strategies. Another simpler step: continue to diversify relay
and MEV infrastructure – support open-source, non-censoring MEV relays
(like UltraSound, Agnostic Relay) and perhaps one day incorporate an
in-protocol auction for MEV that doesn’t censor. If Ethereum remains the
best example of <em>“the network routes around censorship”</em>, it will
uphold its first principles and set itself apart from more permissioned
chains. To quote John Gilmore again: <em>“The Net treats censorship as
damage and routes around it.”</em>​ Ethereum should strive to make this
literally true in its design.</p>
<p><strong>3. Radically Decentralize Staking and Nodes:</strong> The
community must tackle staking centralization head-on to preserve
security and self-sovereignty. Encouraging solo staking should be a
priority – through education, lowering hardware requirements, and
perhaps incentive tweaks. For example, protocols could slightly adjust
rewards: one idea floated is to give <em>marginally higher rewards to
validators beyond the largest pools</em> (to counteract liquidity
advantage). While tricky economically, it’s worth analyzing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, community initiatives like SSV (Secret Shared Validators)
and Obol Network that let users form mini-pools without trusting a
central operator should get broad support. These allow a group of
friends or a DAO to run a validator collectively such that no single one
can misbehave – distributing trust and ensuring no “Lido” grows too
dominant. If Lido remains huge, making it more decentralized internally
(many independent node operators under the Lido umbrella) is the
next-best thing, and indeed Lido is moving that direction.</p>
<p>On the node side, Ethereum should continue investing in light client
protocols. A fully decentralized Ethereum means users shouldn’t have to
rely on Infura/Alchemy to access the chain. Projects like Ultralight
clients (running in browsers or phones) and Portal Network (serving
historical data in decentralized ways) are crucial. When users can
easily run a node or at least a trust-minimized client, the power of
middlemen fades. MetaMask and other wallets can integrate such clients,
reducing the silent centralization of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ethereum governance should welcome more independent
participants: for instance, by supporting community staking projects
(Rocket Pool, decentralized staking collectives) via EF grants or
ecosystem funds. <em>The more entities validating, the more
decentralized Ethereum becomes.</em> Balaji Srinivasan’s <em>Nakamoto
coefficient</em> concept can serve as a KPI: Ethereum should strive to
raise the minimum number of entities required to compromise it​.</p>
<p>Today that number might be ~4 (Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance).
Through the above efforts, perhaps in a couple of years it could be 10
or 20, and none with &gt;10%. Every increment makes Ethereum sturdier
against capture. Decentralizing nodes also has a political effect: it’s
easier for a government to pressure a handful of companies than tens of
thousands of citizens. Therefore, boosting the ranks of home stakers and
node runners is not just a technical goal but a <em>cypherpunk
shield</em> against authority.</p>
<p>Hal Finney dreamed of a world where <em>“untraceable digital
cash”</em> and networks put individuals beyond financial surveillance; a
widely distributed Ethereum fulfills that dream by denying any single
vector for surveillance or shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>4. Reinforce Credible Neutrality and Open Access:</strong>
Ethereum should formally enshrine the principle of credible neutrality
in its culture – and arguably, even in documentation or a
“constitution.” This means making it explicit that <em>the Ethereum
protocol does not discriminate on the basis of origin, destination, or
purpose of transactions</em>. One practical step is for the Ethereum
Foundation and client teams to adopt a “Credible Neutrality Policy.”</p>
<p>For example, they might pledge to never build protocol features that
favor or exclude specific classes of users or applications. Any proposal
that violates neutrality (like say, an EIP to blacklist an address or
give preferential treatment to certain dApps) would be summarily
rejected as against Ethereum’s mission. This norm is mostly in place
already, but stating it clearly would help resolve future ambiguous
cases.</p>
<p>Another aspect is ensuring permissionless access to Ethereum at all
levels. Running a validator only requires 32 ETH and a computer – no
approval needed – and this should remain so (no “staking licenses” or
KYC imposed on the protocol). The same for deploying contracts:
<em>anyone</em> can deploy any code (if they pay gas), and that
neutrality must hold even under external pressure.</p>
<p>To solidify this, the community could produce a short Ethereum Bill
of Rights – e.g., “Any user has the right to self-custody their assets,
to privacy, to inclusion in the ledger if following the protocol rules,
and to fork the protocol code” etc. While not an enforceable legal
document, it would be a guiding light and public commitment. It could
echo the Cypherpunk Manifesto in tone, updated for Ethereum’s
context.</p>
<p>For instance: <em>“Ethereum users are entitled to financial privacy,
security, and autonomy; Ethereum will not be a tool of surveillance or
exclusion.”</em> This kind of declaration, if widely endorsed by
developers, sets the expectation that even as Ethereum interfaces with
the “real world,” it will maintain a <em>permissionless core</em>.
Moreover, cooperation with other open-source and decentralized projects
can amplify this stance.</p>
<p>Ethereum should remain compatible and friendly to networks like
Bitcoin (shared ideals on censorship-resistance) and integrate with
privacy networks (like partnering with Tor/I2P for network layer privacy
or Filecoin/Swarm for uncensorable storage). By being part of a broader
decentralized ecosystem, Ethereum strengthens the “web of
trustlessness.” Vitalik listed <em>“building tools, not empires”</em>
and a <em>“cooperative mindset”</em> as cypherpunk values​ – indeed,
Ethereum should interoperate, not wall itself off. That way, no single
platform dominates; instead, users flow through a constellation of
decentralized services, with Ethereum as one core component.</p>
<p>The overarching point is to keep Ethereum horizontally open, never
vertically integrated into a monopoly. That defends against any one
actor or government capturing the whole stack.</p>
<p><strong>5. Improve Governance Transparency and Community
Voice:</strong> While Ethereum deliberately eschews on-chain governance
(no coin voting in protocol changes), it can still enhance the openness
and inclusivity of its governance process. The AllCoreDevs calls and the
Ethereum Magicians forum are forums for decision-making, but these can
be made more accessible. Simple steps like publishing user-friendly
minutes of core dev calls (already done by contributors like Tim Beiko
and others) and public issue tracking for major decisions help demystify
governance. The community should also insist on a broad consensus
threshold for contentious changes – effectively a social contract that
protocol upgrades will not be forced through against strong opposition
from a significant minority. This informal rule has been followed (e.g.,
ProgPoW GPU-mining change was stalled amid controversy​).</p>
<p>It aligns with the idea that Ethereum’s governance is
legitimacy-based​ – changes need widespread legitimacy, not just a 51%
majority. To realign with cypherpunk roots, Ethereum governance should
favor <em>conservatism</em> in the base layer (to minimize attack
surface and coercion potential) while encouraging
<em>experimentation</em> at the edges (via dApps, L2s, etc.). This way,
the base layer remains a neutral, stable foundation (the cryptographic
commons), much like how the cypherpunks imagined fundamental protocols
(like TCP/IP, PGP) being open infrastructure. One practical initiative
could be to form a “Ethereum Values” working group (somewhat like ETHCat
Herders but focused on philosophical alignment) to periodically evaluate
whether proposals or ecosystem trends uphold the core values. This group
could produce non-binding reports – for instance, assessing the state of
censorship resistance or decentralization each year and recommending
actions (kind of like an accountability report).</p>
<p>Think of it as Ethereum’s internal watchdog for its principles. By
having an organized voice for values, the community ensures that
efficiency or profit motives do not quietly override fundamental
principles.</p>
<p><strong>6. Continue Public Goods Funding for Cypherpunk
Tech:</strong> The Ethereum ecosystem, via entities like the Ethereum
Foundation, Gitcoin, Moloch DAO, etc., should aggressively fund projects
that enhance decentralization and privacy. This includes second-layer
privacy solutions (mixers, ZK-proof systems), decentralized
infrastructure (hosting frontends on IPFS, building decentralized RPC
networks), and alternative client implementations (to keep
diversity).</p>
<p>It also means supporting education and hackathons to bring in
developers passionate about these issues – essentially growing the next
generation of cypherpunks within Ethereum. Recall that early cypherpunks
wrote code and gave it away (PGP, Tor, etc.) as public goods. Ethereum’s
community can mirror that: identify the gaps (like the need for an easy
mobile light wallet, or a truly decentralized exchange that can’t be
shut down) and collectively resource those efforts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ethereum’s culture already leans this way with things
like Gitcoin grants. But scaling it up – perhaps via protocol-funded DAO
funds in the future – will ensure cypherpunk-aligned projects outcompete
VC-funded convenience-oriented ones. An example: instead of relying on
Chainalysis or other blockchain surveillance, Ethereum could fund teams
to build <em>user-friendly coinjoin or ring-signature</em> mechanisms
that make chain analysis harder, protecting users by default.</p>
<p>Another example: funding community-run validator pools in underserved
regions to improve geographic distribution (a form of decentralization
public good). Each public good funded for Ethereum’s decentralization
and privacy is an investment in the network’s long-term
independence.</p>
<p><strong>7. Foster a Culture of Cypherpunk Advocacy:</strong> Lastly,
and perhaps most importantly, Ethereum should nurture its cultural
identity as a cypherpunk project. This involves community leaders and
influencers – from core developers to app developers to educators –
consistently communicating <em>why</em> decentralization and privacy
matter, especially to newcomers attracted by hype or profits.
Initiatives like Ethereum Governance workshops and Ethics in Ethereum
discussions at conferences (Devcon, etc.) can reinforce these
values.</p>
<p>The story of Ethereum should be told not just as “world computer for
cool apps,” but as <em>part of a decades-long struggle for digital
liberty</em>. When people see Ethereum in the lineage of the
cypherpunks, of Bitcoin, of the fight against surveillance, they are
more likely to respect and continue those values. Edward Snowden’s
appearances at crypto conferences (he spoke at EthCC 2022 via video) are
great examples – the community hearing directly from a privacy hero
galvanizes support for those causes. (But as a counterpoint, the U.S.
government is aggressive with its dislike for Snowden, and thus his
involvement likely fuels anti-crypto sentiment currently manifesting in
regulation by enforcement).</p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation could also collaborate with organizations
like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on campaigns around
encryption, or with the Zcash community on privacy research – uniting
the broader cypherpunk-minded communities. Internally, doing regular
“decentralization checkups” – for instance, Ethereum client teams
voluntarily publishing stats on diversity, staking pools reporting on
decentralization efforts – makes it part of the culture to track and
improve these metrics.</p>
<p>And of course, community members should be encouraged to actually
<em>use</em> the decentralized tools: run a node, try a privacy wallet,
experiment with posting content to IPFS via Ethereum. The more firsthand
experience users have with decentralization, the stronger their
commitment to it.</p>
<p>In essence, Ethereum needs to keep alive the restless, rebellious
spirit that birthed it. That spirit can be summarized as: <em>Don’t
Trust. Verify.</em>; <em>Protect the user, not the powers that be.</em>;
<em>Decentralize all the things.</em> It means sometimes making
decisions that favor resilience over short-term adoption. As Vitalik
warned, if we don’t resist convenience that leads to centralization,
we’ll end up rebuilding Web2 on blockchain​. Reclaiming Ethereum’s
cypherpunk soul is about ensuring every layer of the stack and every
layer of the community reflect the fundamental aim of empowering
individuals.</p>
<p>By implementing these steps – embedding privacy, hardening
neutrality, decentralizing participation, and strengthening its culture
– Ethereum can truly <em>“upgrade”</em> itself not just in throughput,
but in principle. The result would be a blockchain that can withstand
state-level attacks on privacy or attempts at control, because its
community and technology are architected to route around them. It would
also differentiate Ethereum in a world where many blockchains are
compromising on decentralization for speed or regulatory acceptance.
Ethereum could proudly stand as <em>the network that will not sell
out</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: A Call to Action for the Ethereum
Community</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum’s journey from a bold experiment to a global platform has
been nothing short of extraordinary. But with success comes the
temptation to compromise – to make small concessions that, over time,
could transform an open network of empowerment into something
unrecognizable. I have argued that Ethereum must consciously
<strong>return to its cypherpunk first principles</strong> now, at this
pivotal moment, to avoid drifting into mediocrity or co-option. This is
not a call to revert to the past, but to carry forward the original
ethos into the future with renewed focus.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Ethereum community already holds the keys
to prevent the network from being derailed. The cypherpunk values of
decentralization, privacy, and censorship-resistance are not abstract
ideals here – they are <em>active design goals</em>, as seen in recent
efforts by core developers and researchers. Vitalik’s reminder that
<em>“if we do not resist, we risk losing the unique value of the crypto
ecosystem”</em>​should ring in our ears. The unique value of Ethereum
<em>is</em> that it enables unstoppable applications and self-sovereign
finance on a scale the world has never seen. To safeguard that, each of
us in the community – developers, node operators, users, educators – has
a role to play.</p>
<p>To Ethereum developers: keep writing code that empowers and protects
users. Optimize for decentralization even if it’s harder. Implement
those privacy features and don’t shy away from tackling censorship at
the protocol level. Remember the old cypherpunk adage: <em>“Cypherpunks
write code”</em>​ – your code can literally preserve freedom for
millions.</p>
<p>To ETH holders and investors: support the long-term health of the
network over short-term gains. Decentralization may not pump token price
overnight, but it is what gives ETH lasting value. Delegate your stake
to smaller pools or run a validator. Fund public goods. Vote with your
capital for projects and companies that uphold Ethereum’s values, not
those who undermine them.</p>
<p>To dApp developers and infrastructure providers: resist the easy path
of centralization. Yes, running your own servers or complying with every
regulation might seem pragmatic – until it erodes the very reason users
want a decentralized app. Innovate on decentralized alternatives. As
Snowden admonished, <em>“the world doesn’t need more banks”</em>​ – so
strive not to build bank-like intermediaries on Ethereum. Instead, build
the tools that let users be their own bank, their own identity provider,
their own custodian.</p>
<p>To regulators and institutions observing Ethereum: understand that
Ethereum’s core principles are its strength, not a weakness. A neutered,
heavily regulated Ethereum that loses its censorship-resistance will
simply see innovation move elsewhere – it would be a lose-lose outcome.
Working with Ethereum means accepting its fundamental properties (just
as the internet’s design had to be accepted). Censorship resistance, for
example, is <em>“the only protection users have from political
change,”</em> as Edward Snowden reminds us​. Don’t push for Ethereum to
become something it isn’t – engage with it on its own terms, which
include openness and neutrality.</p>
<p>And to the <em>Ethereum community at large</em>, spread across
Reddit, Discord, Twitter, hackathons and meetups around the world: this
is your movement<strong>.</strong> The spirit of the cypherpunks lives
on in each one of you who believes that technology can set us free.
Speak up when you see proposals or actions that betray Ethereum’s ethos.
Educate newcomers that decentralization is the <em>feature</em>, not a
bug to be trimmed. Continue the traditions of transparency, inclusivity,
and collaborative dissent that have defined Ethereum’s governance so
far. As the saying goes, <em>the price of liberty is eternal
vigilance</em>. We must be vigilant that Ethereum stays on the path of
liberty.</p>
<p>In 1993, cypherpunk co-founder John Gilmore, photographed with dark
sunglasses on the cover of Wired, declared: <em>“The Net interprets
censorship as damage and routes around it.”</em>​</p>
<p>In 2025 and beyond, let it be said that Ethereum interprets
centralization as damage and routes around it. That will only be true if
we, the Ethereum community, make it so through our choices and
actions.</p>
<p>Ethereum has a chance to be the backbone of a freer, fairer digital
future, but only if it remains faithful to the ideals that birthed it.
By realigning with its cypherpunk first principles, Ethereum can ensure
it doesn’t just survive increased commercialization and regulation – it
thrives <em>without compromising</em> what makes it special. The world
needs a decentralized global platform now more than ever, as financial
systems and social media become ever more centralized and surveilled.
Ethereum can rise to that occasion by doubling down on decentralization
and privacy.</p>
<p>In closing, remember Timothy May’s rallying cry from the Crypto
Anarchist Manifesto: <em>“Arise, you have nothing to lose but your
barbed wire fences!”</em>​ For Ethereum, those fences represent the old
paradigm–centralized control, compromised privacy, and permissioned
innovation. Ethereum was built to tear down such barriers. Now is the
time for the community to recenter on its cypherpunk first principles,
to write code that protects freedom, and to build a blockchain that
lives up to the ideals of its pioneers.</p>
<p>The call to action is clear: Keep Ethereum free, decentralized, and
true to its cypherpunk legacy.</p>
